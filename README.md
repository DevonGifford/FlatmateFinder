## Brief Introduction:

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Flatmate Finder streamlines the flatmate search process with its user-friendly form for potential flatmates. The submitted data is securely stored via Firebase, ensuring privacy and security. Tenants can then conveniently evaluate and rank applicants using a Tinder-like interface.

Built with Vite, TypeScript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, Flatmate Finder delivers a seamless user experience for both potential flatmates and current tenants.
