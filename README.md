# Flatmate Finder 

(work in progress)


Flatmate Finder is an application designed to streamline the process of finding the perfect flatmate. Built with Vite, TypeScript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, it offers a seamless user experience for both potential flatmates and current tenants.

## Overview

This application simplifies the flatmate search by offering a user-friendly form for potential flatmates to fill out. Once the form is completed, the data is securely stored via Firebase, ensuring privacy and security.

### Features

- **User Profiles**: Potential flatmates can create detailed profiles with essential information, preferences, and more.
- **Tenant Access**: Current tenants can access a Tinder-like interface to view profiles and rate potential flatmates.
- **Rating System**: Enables tenants to rate profiles, providing valuable feedback for better decision-making.
- **Leaderboard**: A dynamic leaderboard showcases the most popular and highly-rated flatmate options.

## How It Works
